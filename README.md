# SPADE Project Explorer

## About SPADE
**SPADE** or the **Spatial Data Analysis Explorer** is a full-featured webGIS application built with [GeoNode](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode)—an open source geospatial content management system.

## About Project Explorer
**Project Explorer** is a simple interface to SPADE for non-technical users or users without any GIS backround for doing basic mapping tasks with projects data. It is designed to have an intuitive interface that allows its user to perform a well-defined set of tasks—such as filtering and styling projects based on their attributes—without needing to interact with SPADE’s more complicated interfaces.

**Project Explorer is not a full-featured webGIS**. It is not designed for advanced or complex use cases or to duplicate the features that are already available in SPADE.
